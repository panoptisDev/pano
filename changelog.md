This changelog documents updates relevant to users and downstream integrations. The scope of each version includes changes to the following interfaces:
- Interactions with other nodes in the Pano network.
- Command-line interface and configuration files.
- Execution support for Ethereum transactions and Ethereum-compatible contracts.
- RPC interfaces, including JSON-RPC, WebSockets, and Unix sockets.

## [Unreleased]

Unreleased features are staged for future releases but have not yet undergone 
thorough testing or integration. These changes are experimental and may 
cause unexpected behavior or malfunctions in the client.

For optimal compatibility and stability, it is recommended to use the most recent released version.

### Added
- Introduce support for the Brio hard-fork upgrade.
- Implement CLZ VM instruction [EIP-7939](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7939) when Brio upgrade is enabled.
- Add precompiled contract for secp256r1 Curve Support [EIP-7951](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7951)  when Brio upgrade is enabled.
- Introduce eth_Config RPC method tailored for the Pano network.

### Changed

- Bump minimum required Go version to 1.25.0.
- Increase gas cost for the ModExp precompiled contract in accordance with [EIP-7883](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7883) when the Brio upgrade is enabled.
- Restrict maximum input length for ModExp precompiled contract [EIP-7823](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7823) when Brio upgrade is enabled.
- Introduce protocol-level upper bound gas usage per transaction (à la [EIP-7825](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7825)) when Brio upgrade is enabled.
- Introduce protocol level maximum RLP encoded block size of 10 MiB [EIP-7934](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7934) when Brio upgrade us enabled.

### Removed

## [2.1.5] - TBD

## [2.0.6] - 26 May 2025

- Synchronize access to cached hash in Block - fixes incorrect block hash returned by RPC rarely

- Various fixes and improvements.

## [2.0.2] - 10 Feb 2025

- Implements eth_getAccount RPC method (Fantom-foundation/Pano#370)
- Handle "finalized" and "safe" block number tags (Fantom-foundation/Pano#388)
- Events fetching improved (Fantom-foundation/Pano#372)
- Fixes gas capping in RPC calls (Fantom-foundation/Pano#391)


## [2.0.1] - 10 Feb 2025
-  Adds the new Pano VM for faster contract code processing.
-  Improves upon the Pano DB performance with additional optimizations, especially for the new features.
-  Adds support for Cancun/Deneb including transient storage and new VM opcodes.
-  The Prevrandao is now fully supported in the VM and is ready to be used in contracts. Please note Prevrandao on Pano can not be influenced by a validator not proposing a block.

-  Includes an updated consensus control for stable TTF with improved security of the blocks building.
-  Built-in topology heuristics optimizes the network responsiveness.
- We also included number of smaller bug fixes and improvements across different parts of the system.
