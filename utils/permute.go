// Permute is a utility function that creates an iterator producing all
// permutations of the input slice. Due to the nature of permutations, the
// number of results grows factorially with the size of the input slice, which
// means that practical use is limited to small slices, in particular for test
// case generation.
//
// The resulting iterator produces one result at a time. However, the
// implementation is not optimized for performance nor memory usage. If you
// consider using this function in production code, consider improving its
// implementation.
